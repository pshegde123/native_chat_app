- **Expo CLI** (Optional, for easy app development)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Firebase Setup
To use Firebase with this app, you'll need to set up a Firebase project and replace the Firebase configuration in the App.js file.

Go to the Firebase Console.
Create a new Firebase project.
Add Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase Storage to your project.
Copy the Firebase configuration and paste it into the firebaseConfig object in App.js.
Usage
Once the app is running, you'll be able to:

Sign up and log in anonymously to the app using Firebase Authentication.
Send messages, images, and locations in real-time.
View a list of past messages.
See other users' locations on a map when they share it.

## Troubleshooting
If you face issues with the app, ensure that:

You have granted the necessary permissions for location and camera access.
Your Firebase project is properly set up and configured.
You're connected to the internet when sending real-time data. If you're offline, the app will store messages locally and sync when the connection is restored.
